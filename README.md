# Malware-Detection Using Transfer Learning of ResNet-50

* Implementation of the article ["Malicious Software Classification using Transfer
Learning of ResNet-50 Deep Neural Network"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320059379_Malicious_Software_Classification_Using_Transfer_Learning_of_ResNet-50_Deep_Neural_Network) 
under "classifier.ipynb".
Achieved 97% Accuracy.

* Change the latter to DETECT malware, i.e- to distinguish between benign and malicious software.

* Data:
    * MalImg dataset- consists of 9,339 labeled malware binary images in 25 different malware classes.
    * Benign dataset- created by us, consists of 13,000 benign binary images.
